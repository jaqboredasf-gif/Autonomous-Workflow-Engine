# Decision Log

Append-only. Newest first. Format: date — decision — why — supersedes (if any).

## 2026-07-17 (boss-priority finding — challenges Phase 4 MVP)

- **Finding (not yet a decision):** boss's #1 removable task = daily punch
  verification + job-number entry into ExakTime (~1 hr/day). Wants ~1-mile geofence
  validation. This is Workstream A, mostly built. **MVP-priority challenge for Phase
  4:** candidate first demo = daily attendance exception report (wrong-site +
  overtime flags + job-number sync) — zero Entra/Graph blockers, direct hit on
  boss's stated pain — with email-triage pipeline second. DECIDE IN PHASE 4, not
  before. Interview closer 2 ("mistake automation must never make") still unasked.
- Working model in CURRENT_WORKFLOW.md affirmed broadly correct (values still open).

## 2026-07-17 (Phase 2 permissions session)

- **Multi-role via `user_roles` join table.** One human, many hats (office admin +
  dispatcher likely same person). Existing `users.role` kept for Workstream A during
  migration; Workstream B RLS reads join table. Migration design in Phase 5.
- **Customer = email-only actor in MVP.** No login, no portal. M365/Outlook carries
  customer communications including most of the invoicing pipeline. Portal = future.
- **Sysadmin (Jack) barred from business approvals in production.** Keeps audit
  trail meaningful. Test-phase exception: fixture data only.
- **message_policies gets amount-threshold column now.** Cheap to design in; values
  stay empty until boss answers interview §3 (approval limits by job value).
- **v1 invoice flow confirmed:** system drafts invoice record → human creates real
  invoice in QuickBooks manually, sends via Outlook → marks sent in system. System is
  status-tracker only until QB/Graph integration (Option B).
- STAKEHOLDERS_AND_PERMISSIONS.md structure approved; only B2-dependent facts open.
- BOSS_INTERVIEW.md capture sheet created (12 rounds, maps to B#/I# question IDs).

## 2026-07-17 (Phase 1 discovery session)

- **Auto-decline disabled entirely until owner approves verified territory rule set.**
  Out-of-territory → drafted decline for human review, even for seemingly definite
  rules. v1 ships with zero auto-sends until that approval. Why: territory data is
  SAMPLE; real rules live in owner's head; wrong auto-decline = lost revenue.
  *Refines 2026-07-16 "v1 auto-send = out-of-territory decline only" — the auto mode
  remains the design target but is feature-flagged off pending owner sign-off.*
- **MVP intake is email-first; phone intake is a future workflow.** Phone is the
  larger channel (~10–20 calls vs ~3–10 emails/day, unconfirmed) but email is written,
  classifiable, auditable. MVP explicitly does not claim to solve intake. Bridge:
  manual intake form for office staff to enter phone requests into the same
  work_request pipeline — scope it in Phase 4 as shortly-after-MVP.
- **Territory rules must be extensible from day one**: zips, towns, counties, mileage
  radius, per-customer + per-job-type exceptions, recorded reason for every
  accept/decline/escalate.
- **Permissions designed per-role, not per-person.** Several roles are likely the same
  human; org chart unconfirmed. Phase 2 defines role capabilities that survive any
  headcount answer.
- **Current-state workflow documented as WORKING MODEL** (CURRENT_WORKFLOW.md), not
  fact. Confirmation checklist = ASSUMPTIONS_AND_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md sections A–C.

## 2026-07-16 (grill session — previously in SESSION_HANDOFF.md)

- Cutover: 2 matching parallel pay periods vs ExakTime; ExakTime = fallback.
- Boss's scope = request→invoice pipeline (email formalized in USER_WORKFLOWS.md).
- v1 auto-send: out-of-territory decline ONLY; all else drafts; final invoice never auto. *(Refined 2026-07-17 — see above.)*
- Emergency detection = required MVP; configurable contacts; no troubleshooting advice ever.
- Shared mailbox ≠ shared calendar; dedicated requests@ mailbox preferred; owner inbox untouchable.
- Pricing: placeholders only; source + last-updated mandatory; incomplete pricing blocks send.
- QuickBooks: Option B (integrate after core workflow) — see INTEGRATIONS.md.
- Fixtures-first email build; Entra app registration = blocking dependency for all real-mail work.
